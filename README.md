## On a Mission to Mars

In this challenge, I use my webscraping skills to extract data from two websites using Devtools such as Beautiful Soup(for HTML parsing) and Splinter(for automated browsing). While the first part of the assignment was to employ the basics of web-scraping, the second part used this as a means to conduct further analysis into the data using Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib. The following questions have been answered with the analysis.

1. How many months exist on Mars?\n
A. There seems to be 12 martian months on Mars, each varying in the amount of terrestrial days or days on earth.

2. How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
A. There are 1867 days worth of data.

3. Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? 
A. On average, the 3rd month had the lowest temperature and the 8th month had the highest.

4. Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
A. On average, the 6th month had lowest atmospheric pressure and the 9th month had the highest.

5. How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made.
A. The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
